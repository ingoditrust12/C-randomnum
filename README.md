C ++ code that Prints a random number and states whether it is positive, negative, or zero.


In this code, we use srand and rand functions from the ctime library to generate a random number. We set the random number seed to the current time so that we get different random numbers every time we run the program.

We use the modulo operator (%) to restrict the range of the random number between -100 and 100. Then, we print out the random number and determine whether it is positive, negative, or zero using an if-else statement.
